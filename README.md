# Team “Slayers”

## Auction “Search a lot”

### Research

In our journey to create an online auction, our team meticulously examined the user flows of three prominent auction marketplaces: eBay, Copart, and Violity UA. Through this analysis, we gained valuable insights into how these platforms organize their flows, and drive successful auctions.

We invite you to explore the results of our research through the attached link, where you'll find a comprehensive overview of our findings.

Based on our thorough research, we have crafted our own solution. You can explore its description below.
